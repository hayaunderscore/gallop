> A hachimi module

**Trainers' Gallop U** (or libgallop) is a [Hachimi](https://hachimi.noccu.art/) module that adds some features similar to the original [Trainers' Legend G](https://github.com/MinamiChiwa/Trainers-Legend-G) to enhance the ウマ娘プリティーダービー (Umamusume: Pretty Derby) experience.

## Notice

- As this is a module, there are chances that **you might get banned by Cygames for using this**. Use at your own risk.
- For translations, look into [Hachimi](https://hachimi.noccu.art/), which by itself handles translations. This module only provides more niche features out of scope of the Hachimi project.

## Building

This uses CMake and MinGW for building the dll file (`libgallop.dll`/`gallop.dll`).

1. Get [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/). Make sure you are in the MinGW environment when compiling.
2. `git clone`
3. Create the build files using `cmake --preset Build -B build`.
4. Compile using `cmake --build build`.
5. A dll file should be available in the build folder. Proceed to [Usage](#usage).

## Usage

This module is meant to be used with [Hachimi(-Edge)](https://hachimi.noccu.art/).

This module works on Windows 10 and Linux (via Proton). Linux users will need to use a patched out executable and Proton versions compatible with Umamusume (GE-Proton 10-12 or Proton-CachyOS).

1. Install Hachimi, setting up DLL redirection if needed.
2. In the `hachimi` folder (appears once the game is launched with Hachimi atleast once), edit `config.json` and add the path to the CarrotJuicer dll to `load_libraries`.
```json
"load_libraries": [
  "hachimi\\libgallop.dll"
],
```
3. Start the game as usual (i.e., with DMM launcher/Steam).
4. You should see a separate window when launching the game. If you see it, congratulations!
